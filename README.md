# Advent of code 2024

After many years trying new languages, comes time to do it in the tool I use for work, good old Java.

These will be quick and dirty solutions I try to put together in the morning before work.
Keep judgement to the bare minimum ğŸ˜…

## Day generator
To generate the files for a new day, run the following command from the root directory of the repository:

```sh dayGenerator.sh <dayNumber>```

This will create the java class file for the day from a template, the test class file and the input and test files.

## Progress
